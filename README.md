# Networks
 Cross-platform network utilities. 
	
Server, client, buffer serializable both to files, sockets, and whatever you need, customizable for user-defined classes, and more. Semi-active project.

To compile (althought the "library" itself is cross-platform, the build batch file works only on Windows) run "compile.bat".
